# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The video upload system currently fails when network connections are interrupted during large file uploads, leaving orphaned video files without proper metadata registration. This feature will implement a robust upload recovery system that can handle network interruptions, resume uploads, and recover orphaned files to ensure reliable video processing and delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading large video files, I want the system to recover from network interruptions so that I don't lose my upload progress and can complete the upload successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network connection is interrupted during upload THEN the system SHALL preserve the partially uploaded file
2. WHEN an upload is resumed THEN the system SHALL continue from the last successful chunk
3. WHEN an upload completes after recovery THEN the system SHALL generate proper metadata and download links
4. IF an upload fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and recover orphaned video files so that successful uploads are not lost due to metadata registration failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL scan for orphaned video files without metadata
2. WHEN orphaned files are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconstruct metadata from available information
3. WHEN metadata reconstruction is successful THEN the system SHALL register the video and provide download links
4. IF metadata reconstruction fails THEN the system SHALL log the issue and provide manual recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want upload progress to be persistent across browser sessions so that I can resume uploads even after closing and reopening the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL store upload state persistently
2. WHEN a user returns to the upload page THEN the system SHALL detect incomplete uploads
3. WHEN resuming an upload THEN the system SHALL display previous progress and continue from the correct position
4. WHEN an upload is completed or cancelled THEN the system SHALL clean up persistent state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of upload failures so that I can identify and resolve systemic issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including network conditions
2. WHEN recovery attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log recovery actions and outcomes
3. WHEN orphaned files are detected THEN the system SHALL log file details and recovery attempts
4. IF recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages for manual intervention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate file integrity during and after upload so that corrupted files are detected and handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a file THEN the system SHALL calculate and verify checksums for each chunk
2. WHEN an upload completes THEN the system SHALL verify the complete file integrity
3. IF file corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and request re-upload
4. WHEN file integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal processing and metadata registration
